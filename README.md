### 🔥 **Game-Changer for African Agriculture**  
AfriCrop leverages **blockchain + IoT + ML** to create Africa's first farmer-led DAO for sustainable agriculture. By tracking crop stages and farming practices on-chain, we’re building a verifiable supply chain that automatically calculates sustainability scores and distributes rewards.  

**Backed by Research**:  
- FAO reports 60% of African farms lack access to credit ([Source](https://www.fao.org/africa/news/detail-news/en/c/1613472/))  
- World Bank estimates 30% yield increase with sustainable practices ([Source](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture))

## 🛠 **Core Innovations**  

### 1. **Crop Stage Tracking (Supply Chain Integrity)**  
- Records planting → harvest → distribution on blockchain  
- Each stage updates sustainability score dynamically  
- Example: Organic maize gets +15% score vs conventional  

### 2. **Farmer DAO Governance**  
- Tokenized voting on sustainability standards  
- Community-approved reward distribution  
- Proposal system for new farming techniques  

### 3. **IoT + ML Integration** *(In Development)*  
- **Soil sensors** feed real-time data to smart contracts  
- **ML model** predicts optimal planting times  
- **Satellite imagery** verifies farm activities

## 🌱 **Sustainability Impact**  

### **Stage-Based Scoring System**  
| Crop Stage        | Sustainability Factors Tracked          | Weight |  
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|  
| **Planting**      | Seed type, Soil prep                   | 20%    |  
| **Growth**        | Water use, Fertilizers                 | 40%    |  
| **Harvest**       | Yield efficiency                       | 30%    |  
| **Distribution**  | Transportation emissions               | 10%    |  

*Example: A farmer using drip irrigation (+25pts) and organic compost (+20pts) would score 45/100 in the Growth stage.*

## 🚀 **Why This Matters for Africa**  

1. **Financial Inclusion**  
   - Unlocks DeFi loans using sustainability scores as collateral  
2. **Climate Resilience**  
   - 70% of African farms are rain-fed (World Bank) - our system incentivizes water conservation  
3. **Supply Chain Transparency**  
   - Buyers trace produce from seed to market  

**Projected Impact**:  
- 50% reduction in fraudulent "organic" claims  
- 35% increase in farmer income through token rewards
